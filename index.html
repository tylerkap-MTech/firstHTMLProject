    <h2>This is page about me!</h2>
    
    <h3>&lt;Insert funny joke here&gt;</h3>
    
    <h4>Quick Summary:</h4>
    <p>Lately, I have been discribing myself as someone who is <span style="font-weight: bold;">passionately curious</span>. The world is a strage, yet beautful palce, filled with microcosms within microcosms.
        Each time I explore, I find some other world that would take a lifetime to navigate. There is much to do and much to learn. I am often mesmerized by the expertise
        others. There is a saying that interested people are intersting. I strive to be an intereseted person. Interested in the world, its wonders and its elusive mysteries. 
        I wonder what is out there?
    </p>
    <h4><pre>Here is just a few ways I like to spend my interested time:</pre></h4>
    
    <p>1. Our bodies are the medium of how we experience life. I make an effort to take care of my body through exercise, sports, and classic skating.</p>
    <p>2. I have had a resurgent interted in numbers. I apperciate the objectivity and puzzle solving of math.</p>
    <P>3. Likewise, and no suprise, I enjoy the puzzle solving and creativity of programming. I endeavor to understand the meanings and workings of 1's and 0's. </P>

    <br/>

    <p>P.s. I hope your day is going well. &gt;_&lt;</p>
